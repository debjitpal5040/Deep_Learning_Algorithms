# MNIST

MNIST stands for Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology, which is a dataset of handwritten digits used for training and testing image processing systems.

The MNIST dataset is a collection of 70,000 handwritten digits (0-9) images, with 60,000 images for training and 10,000 images for testing. Each image is a 28x28 grayscale image, and the goal is to correctly classify each image into its corresponding digit class. The MNIST dataset is commonly used as a benchmark dataset for image classification tasks in machine learning and computer vision.
