# Fashion-MNIST

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of images consisting of 10 different fashion categories, with 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Each image is a 28x28 grayscale image, and the goal is to correctly classify each image into its corresponding fashion category. The Fashion-MNIST dataset is often used as a drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset, as it is more challenging and better represents real-world computer vision tasks.
