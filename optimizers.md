# Optimizers

    1.  SGD
Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a simple and efficient optimization algorithm for minimizing an objective function. It is one of the most widely used optimization algorithms in machine learning.

SGD works by iteratively updating the model parameters in the direction of the negative gradient of the objective function. The gradient is an estimate of the direction of steepest descent, i.e., the direction in which the objective function decreases most rapidly.

SGD is a stochastic algorithm, which means that it updates the parameters using a randomly selected subset of the training data. This makes it computationally efficient, as it does not need to compute the gradient over the entire training set at each iteration.

SGD is also a robust algorithm, which means that it can be used to train machine learning models with a wide variety of data sets. It is not sensitive to the initialization of the model parameters, and it can handle noisy data.

The main drawback of SGD is that it can be slow to converge. This is because it only updates the parameters in the direction of the negative gradient, which may not be the best direction to minimize the objective function.

To improve the convergence of SGD, it is often used with momentum. Momentum is a technique that helps SGD to "overcome" local minima. It does this by adding a weighted average of the previous gradients to the current gradient. This helps SGD to take larger steps in the direction of the negative gradient, which can help it to converge more quickly.

SGD is a versatile and powerful optimization algorithm that is widely used in machine learning. It is a good choice for training machine learning models with a wide variety of data sets.

Here are some of the benefits of using SGD optimizer:

* It is computationally efficient, as it does not need to compute the gradient over the entire training set at each iteration.
* It is a robust algorithm, which means that it can be used to train machine learning models with a wide variety of data sets.
* It is relatively easy to implement.

Here are some of the drawbacks of using SGD optimizer:

* It can be slow to converge.
* It can be sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the learning rate.
* It can be noisy, which can lead to oscillations in the training process.

Overall, SGD optimizer is a powerful and versatile optimization algorithm that is widely used in machine learning. It is a good choice for training machine learning models with a wide variety of data sets. However, it is important to be aware of its limitations and to choose the hyperparameters carefully in order to achieve good results.

    2.  Adam

Adam is a popular optimization algorithm for training deep learning models. It is a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method that combines the advantages of momentum and adaptive learning rate methods.

Adam works by maintaining an exponentially weighted average of the first and second moments of the gradients. The first moment is used to estimate the direction of the steepest descent, and the second moment is used to estimate the magnitude of the noise in the gradients. This information is used to update the model parameters in a way that is both efficient and effective.

Adam has several advantages over other SGD methods. It is more efficient than SGD with momentum, as it does not need to store all of the previous gradients. It is also more effective than AdaGrad, as it does not suffer from the problem of diminishing learning rates.

Adam is a good choice for training deep learning models with a wide variety of data sets. It is relatively easy to implement and does not require much tuning. In most cases, it will outperform other SGD methods without any additional configuration.

Here are some of the benefits of using Adam optimizer:

* It is more efficient than SGD with momentum.
* It is more effective than AdaGrad.
* It is relatively easy to implement.
* It does not require much tuning.

Here are some of the drawbacks of using Adam optimizer:

* It can be sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the learning rate and beta parameters.
* It can be noisy, which can lead to oscillations in the training process.

Overall, Adam is a powerful and versatile optimization algorithm that is widely used in machine learning. It is a good choice for training deep learning models with a wide variety of data sets. However, it is important to be aware of its limitations and to choose the hyperparameters carefully in order to achieve good results.

Here is a brief overview of the Adam algorithm:

1. Initialize the model parameters and the Adam state variables.
2. For each epoch:
    * Sample a batch of data from the training set.
    * Calculate the gradients of the loss function with respect to the model parameters.
    * Update the Adam state variables using the gradients.
    * Update the model parameters using the Adam state variables.
3. Repeat steps 2-3 until the desired convergence criteria are met.

The Adam state variables are:

* m: The exponentially weighted average of the gradients.
* v: The exponentially weighted average of the squared gradients.
* bias_correction1: A correction term for the bias in m.
* bias_correction2: A correction term for the bias in v.

The Adam algorithm updates the model parameters as follows:

* m_t = β1 * m_{t-1} + (1 - β1) * g_t
* v_t = β2 * v_{t-1} + (1 - β2) * g_t^2
* m_t_corrected = m_t / (1 - β1^t)
* v_t_corrected = v_t / (1 - β2^t)
* θ_t = θ_{t-1} - α * m_t_corrected / (sqrt(v_t_corrected) + ε)

where:

* g_t is the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model parameters at time t.
* θ_t is the value of the model parameters at time t.
* α is the learning rate.
* ε is a small constant to prevent division by zero.
* β1 and β2 are hyperparameters that control the decay rates of m and v.

The Adam algorithm is a popular choice for training deep learning models because it is efficient, effective, and easy to implement. It is a good choice for most deep learning problems, but it may not be the best choice for all problems. It is important to experiment with different hyperparameters to find the best settings for your specific problem.

    3. RMSProp

RMSprop (root mean square prop) is a stochastic gradient descent optimization algorithm that is commonly used in deep learning. It was first proposed by Geoffrey Hinton in 2012.

RMSprop works by maintaining a moving average of the squared gradients. The moving average is then used to normalize the gradients before they are used to update the model parameters. This helps to stabilize the training process and prevent the gradients from exploding or vanishing.

RMSprop is a relatively simple algorithm to implement, and it has been shown to be effective for training deep learning models on a variety of tasks. It is often used in conjunction with momentum, which can further improve the convergence of the algorithm.

Here is a brief overview of the RMSprop algorithm:

1. Initialize the model parameters and the RMSprop state variables.
2. For each epoch:
    * Sample a batch of data from the training set.
    * Calculate the gradients of the loss function with respect to the model parameters.
    * Update the RMSprop state variables using the gradients.
    * Update the model parameters using the RMSprop state variables.
3. Repeat steps 2-3 until the desired convergence criteria are met.

The RMSprop state variables are:

* g_t: The squared gradients at time t.
* m_t: The moving average of g_t.
* θ_t: The value of the model parameters at time t.
* α: The learning rate.
* ε: A small constant to prevent division by zero.

The RMSprop algorithm updates the model parameters as follows:

* m_t = β * m_{t-1} + (1 - β) * g_t^2
* θ_t = θ_{t-1} - α * g_t / sqrt(m_t + ε)

where:

* g_t is the squared gradient of the loss function with respect to the model parameters at time t.
* θ_t is the value of the model parameters at time t.
* α is the learning rate.
* ε is a small constant to prevent division by zero.
* β is a hyperparameter that controls the decay rate of the moving average.

RMSprop is a popular choice for training deep learning models because it is efficient, effective, and easy to implement. It is a good choice for most deep learning problems, but it may not be the best choice for all problems. It is important to experiment with different hyperparameters to find the best settings for your specific problem.

* It can be sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, such as the learning rate and β.
* It can be noisy, which can lead to oscillations in the training process.

Overall, RMSprop is a powerful and versatile optimization algorithm that is widely used in machine learning. It is a good choice for training deep learning models with a wide variety of data sets. However, it is important to be aware of its limitations and to choose the hyperparameters carefully in order to achieve good results.
